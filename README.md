## Console-Based Calculator Program in C
This is a console-based calculator program written in C that accepts mathematical expressions in the form of strings. The program evaluates the expression and returns the result. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

### Problem Statement
+ The program should accept input as a string, containing integers and operators (+, -, *, /).
+ It should evaluate the expression according to the order of operations (DMAS â€“ Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).
+ The result of the division should be an integer, truncating any remainder.
+ Whitespace between numbers and operators should be ignored.
Error handling for invalid expressions and division by zero is required.
### Features
+ Arithmetic Operations: Supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
+ Integer Division: The result of division is truncated to an integer, even if there is a remainder.
+ Whitespace Handling: Ignores whitespace between numbers and operators.
+ Error Handling:
  + Handles invalid expressions (e.g., non-numeric characters).
  + Displays an error message for division by zero.
  + Order of Operations: Follows the DMAS order of operations to evaluate expressions correctly.
